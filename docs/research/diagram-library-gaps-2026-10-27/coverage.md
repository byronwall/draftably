# Coverage across 15 alternatives

This is a reviewed projection of the Pro research, checked October 28, 2026.
The baseline is `2995a98eef31803fa8669a7ada5c8f8892486bb7`.
See [the decision](summary.md), [next steps](next-steps.md), and
[the source conversation](https://chatgpt.com/c/6ae1522f-1664-83ea-aade-5b585e44394d).

N = native; P = partial or ordinary approximation; C = custom application work;
E = named extension or separate edition; U = unavailable in the evaluated scope;
? = insufficient evidence. Paid does not mean non-native. Native does not mean standards conformance.

Counts exclude Draftably. The denominator is 15 alternatives, including six text languages.
A toolkit demo does not establish native notation. A label can approximate a meaning without validating it.
These counts describe this comparison set. They do not measure demand or market share.

The two CSV companions retain each judgment, its reason, edition scope, direct evidence URLs, and date.
They remove repeated research bookkeeping from the original downloads.

Compound rows bundle related features. A P can mean only one part of the bundle exists.
For example, Draftably has sequence phases but lacks fragments and activation intervals.

## Diagram families

## Interpretation limits

- The set contains popular and influential tools, rather than a claimed global top-15 ranking.
- Text DSLs and application toolkits answer different jobs. Read their scope before comparing totals.
- A source-portability judgment uses `.draft` mode for Draftably, rather than its broader standalone editor.
- Named SQL-field endpoints count as ports within that family. They do not imply general declared ports.
- Shape-based BPMN approximations do not imply a BPMN metamodel, XML exchange, or execution.
- Source-bearing images are confirmed for PlantUML and nomnoml. Unknowns prevent an exclusivity claim.
- Third-party extensions have separate licenses. In particular, the researched Cytoscape SVG extension is GPL-3.0.
- These are documentation and source assessments. Competitor renderers were not benchmarked.
- Codex checked the main Draftably claims and selected primary sources. It did not execute 1,040 independent trials.
