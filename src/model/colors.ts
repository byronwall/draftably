/**
 * The colors an object is drawn in. A file names a family and maybe a shade; drawing adds one
 * rule on top, so nesting stays readable without the author doing shade arithmetic:
 *
 * - A container inside a container of the same family steps one shade toward emphasis per level
 *   (lighter frames underneath, smaller and stronger ones on top), instead of repeating the fill.
 * - A shape whose shade is within two steps of its container's, in the same family, moves three
 *   steps past the container, so a member never melts into its frame.
 *
 * The canvas, the CLI's SVG and exports all draw through `drawnSwatch`.
