/* Joint port selection and obstacle-aware routing.
 * Original local implementation, not libavoid. Pure input/output, Browser + Node.
 * Node positions are never changed. Explicit sides and waypoints are constraints.
 *
 * The phases live in `routing/`: port choice (ports, sidepairs), path search (doglegs, search,
 * find), scoring (conflicts, cost, score), and the passes over the whole drawing (improve,
 * repair, nudge, tidy).
